Taction

This is a physics engine based on the blog posts by Randy Gaul.
The goal of this project is to learn about computing physics in video games and rendering with OpenGL.
This project allows me to get a better understanding of collision detection algorithm and more broadly the implementation of a physic system in a video game.

Taction currently supports the following : 
- OBB and Circle collisions
- force based impulse (no torque)
- basic friction

In the near futur :
- ImGui based debugging window
- torque and contact point based impulse
- proper broad phase and narrow phase implementation
- rendering optimization

# Install
Download the source code, create a build folder using cmake. Open in visual studio, build and run.
